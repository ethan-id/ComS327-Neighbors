    Started Porting to C++
2/27/23
    6:00pm-6:52pm
        Updated makefile
            updated linking line to use C++ compiler instead of C as instructed in assignment description
            Moved placement of -lncurses flag
        ~6:30pm: Working on fixing errors after renaming file to .cpp
            Fixed all errors about invalid conversion from 'void*' to 'class*' with static_cast usages
            Now getting undefined reference errors from my min priority queue.
        6:50pm: Finished porting everything to c++
            Fixed undefined reference errors by wrapping my #include 'heap.h' line with extern "C" {}
        To-Do
            Re-implement ability to travel between maps & fly command
            Prevent NPCs from entering gates
    7:00pm-7:08pm
        Adding conditionals to prevent NPCs from entering gates
        To-Do
            Re-implement ability to travel between maps & fly command
                Idea: Add check to player movement's if user attempts to move into a gate, call generateTerrain
                    Will probably need to pass the world around the program.
