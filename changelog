    Started Porting to C++
3/27/23
    6:00pm-6:52pm
        Updated makefile
            updated linking line to use C++ compiler instead of C as instructed in assignment description
            Moved placement of -lncurses flag
        ~6:30pm: Working on fixing errors after renaming file to .cpp
            Fixed all errors about invalid conversion from 'void*' to 'class*' with static_cast usages
            Now getting undefined reference errors from my min priority queue.
        6:50pm: Finished porting everything to c++
            Fixed undefined reference errors by wrapping my #include 'heap.h' line with extern "C" {}
        To-Do
            Re-implement ability to travel between maps & fly command
            Prevent NPCs from entering gates
    7:00pm-7:08pm
        Adding conditionals to prevent NPCs from entering gates
        To-Do
            Re-implement ability to travel between maps & fly command
                Idea: Add check to player movement's if user attempts to move into a gate, call generateTerrain
                    Will probably need to pass the world around the program.

    10:30am-2:00pm
        Trying to add back in movement through maps.
            Some refactoring of generateTrainers(), generateTerrain(), and main()
    2:20pm-3:20pm
        Finally got terrains to generate after player steps into gate
        To-Do
            Adjust player position after movement through gate
            Make it so map data (trainer positions and defeated status) is retained during travel between maps
            Make travelling loop, right now you can travel one map, then the game quits after you try to walk into another gate
    3:20pm-4:59pm
        Working on making player position retain through travel
        Implemented inheritance in structs.
    5:00pm-5:29pm
        Player position is now retained during travel through gates
            getting some random seg faults tho
            seems consisently faulting after travelling through one gate, then attempting to travel east
                very strange
        Player can now travel through multiple gates without game just quitting
        To-Do
            Implement fly command
            Make it so player can't spawn on gate
    6:20pm-6:49pm
        Implemented user actions to activate fly command and gather input for where to fly
            Need to make it actually fly there now
    6:50pm-8:02pm
        Flying actually flies now
        To-Do
            Sort out seg faults
    8:04pm-8:13pm
        Seems like the seg faults are occuring exclusively when back-tracking into terrain already generated, was able to explore into new maps for a solid few minutes with no faults on multiple occasions.
    8:15pm
        Also noted that transitioning between two maps by travelling north and south repeatedly seems to not cause faults.
        Travelling west also seems to freeze the game
