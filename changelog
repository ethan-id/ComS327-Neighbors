    Started Porting to C++
2/27/23
    6:00pm-6:52pm
        Updated makefile
            updated linking line to use C++ compiler instead of C as instructed in assignment description
            Moved placement of -lncurses flag
        ~6:30pm: Working on fixing errors after renaming file to .cpp
            Fixed all errors about invalid conversion from 'void*' to 'class*' with static_cast usages
            Now getting undefined reference errors from my min priority queue.
        6:50pm: Finished porting everything to c++
            Fixed undefined reference errors by wrapping my #include 'heap.h' line with extern "C" {}
        To-Do
            Re-implement ability to travel between maps & fly command
            Prevent NPCs from entering gates
    7:00pm-7:08pm
        Adding conditionals to prevent NPCs from entering gates
        To-Do
            Re-implement ability to travel between maps & fly command
                Idea: Add check to player movement's if user attempts to move into a gate, call generateTerrain
                    Will probably need to pass the world around the program.

    10:30am-2:00pm
        Trying to add back in movement through maps.
            Some refactoring of generateTrainers(), generateTerrain(), and main()
    2:20pm-3:20pm
        Finally got terrains to generate after player steps into gate
        To-Do
            Adjust player position after movement through gate
            Make it so map data (trainer positions and defeated status) is retained during travel between maps
            Make travelling loop, right now you can travel one map, then the game quits after you try to walk into another gate
